# Common Minecraft Scripting API Errors and Solutions

This document summarizes common errors encountered and resolved while developing Bedrock scripting packs.

---

### 1. Privilege Errors with `BlockPermutation.resolve()`

*   **Error Message**: `ReferenceError: Native function [BlockPermutation::resolve] does not have required privileges.`
*   **Problem**: The `BlockPermutation.resolve("some:block")` function is restricted and cannot be called in most standard script execution contexts. It requires a special, "privileged" context that is not typically available.
*   **Solution**:
    *   **Avoid `resolve`**: Do not use `BlockPermutation.resolve()` to get a permutation.
    *   **For Placing Blocks**: First, change the block's type using `block.setType("your:block_id")`. Then, if you need the permutation object, get it from the block instance you just modified: `const permutation = block.permutation;`.
    *   **For Removing Blocks**: To set a block to air, use `block.setType("air")`.

### 2. World-Editing in `beforeEvents` or `afterEvents` Handlers

*   **Error Message**: Can manifest as privilege errors or other unexpected behavior.
*   **Problem**: Performing world-modifying actions (like `setType`, `setPermutation`, running commands) directly inside an event handler (especially `beforeEvents`) is often restricted. These actions must be deferred.
*   **Solution**:
    *   **Use `system.run()`**: Wrap your world-editing code inside `system.run(() => { ... })`. This schedules the function to run on the next tick, which is a safe context for such operations.

    ```javascript
    // Incorrect
    world.afterEvents.itemUse.subscribe(event => {
        event.source.getBlockFromViewDirection().block.setType("minecraft:gold_block");
    });

    // Correct
    world.afterEvents.itemUse.subscribe(event => {
        system.run(() => {
            event.source.getBlockFromViewDirection().block.setType("minecraft:gold_block");
        });
    });
    ```

### 3. Incorrect `this` Context in Monkey-Patching

*   **Error Message**: `TypeError: not a function` or `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...')` when calling an overridden method.
*   **Problem**: When overriding a prototype method (e.g., `Block.prototype.setType`), the `this` keyword inside the new function may not refer to the instance (e.g., the `Block` object) as expected.
*   **Solution**:
    *   **Use `apply`**: Use `Function.prototype.apply(this, args)` to call the original method. This correctly passes the original `this` context and all arguments.

    ```javascript
    // Incorrect
    const originalSetType = Block.prototype.setType;
    Block.prototype.setType = function(type) {
        originalSetType(type); // 'this' is lost
        console.log("Block type changed!");
    };

    // Correct
    const originalSetType = Block.prototype.setType;
    Block.prototype.setType = function(...args) {
        originalSetType.apply(this, args); // 'this' is preserved
        console.log("Block type changed!");
        BlockUpdate.trigger(this); // 'this' is the block instance
    };
    ```

### 4. Subscribing to Undefined or Deprecated Events

*   **Error Message**: `TypeError: cannot read property 'subscribe' of undefined`
*   **Problem**: The script is trying to attach a listener to an event that doesn't exist in the version of the API being used (e.g., `world.beforeEvents.itemUseOn` which was removed).
*   **Solution**:
    *   **Check API Version**: Ensure you are using the correct event names for your specified API version (`"module_name": "@minecraft/server", "version": "x.x.x"` in the manifest).
    *   **Use Correct Events**: Replace deprecated event listeners with their modern equivalents (e.g., use `world.afterEvents.itemUse` or `world.afterEvents.itemUseOn`).
    *   **Consolidate Handlers**: Avoid subscribing to multiple, similar events (`itemUse` and `itemUseOn`) if one can handle the required logic, as it can lead to conflicts or redundant code.
